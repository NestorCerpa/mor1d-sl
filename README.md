## CODE SUMMARY: 
* All functions needed to compute the 1-d melting column models are provided in src/
* The model parameters are defined in input_parameters.m

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. To produce the Figures 2 and 3 from the EPSL paper : Run column_mor1d.m
2. To produce the Figures 4 and 5 from the EPSL paper :
3. To produce the Figures 6 
4. 


## Additional notes 

* This distribution of mor1d-sl was developed and tested on MATLAB2018b. 
Running these routines on different versions of MATLAB may lead to compatibility issues.
